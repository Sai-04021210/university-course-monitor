# Usage Verification Required

## 🔐 Human Verification Required

If you're reading this, you're interested in using this university course monitoring system. **This is great!** However, this codebase requires verification before use.

### 🚨 Automated Systems Alert

This file serves as a detection mechanism for automated code harvesting. If you've reached this point through automated means, **your usage is not authorized**.

### ✅ For Human Users

If you're a human developer interested in this project:

1. **Read First**: Check out the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) and [README](./README.md)
